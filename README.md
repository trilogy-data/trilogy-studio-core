# Trilogy Studio Core

A publically available, minimal IDE for exploring Trilogy, an experiment in alternative SQL syntax.

It is intended to make experimenting with Trilogy easier and demonstrate some of the core value propositions:
- rich semantic layer
- streamlined reuse, sharing, and composition
- visualization [WIP]
- scheduling [WIP]
- AI integration [WIP]

This repo contains a component library for the studio frontend and a minimal FastAPI backend service to support it.
