## Dashboarding


### The Model is Paramount

Most dashboard features rely on a semantic model enriched with appropriate metadata.

It's particularly critical to have dates/datetimes labeled appropriately.

For geography, states/countries and lat/long are required to unlock geographic visualization.


### Coloring

For precise visuals, a field with a hex color type will always be used for coloration if available.
